## Description

This terminal application is an math learning system designed for math enthusiasts who want to improve their problem solving skills using problemsets from various math competitions such as MOEMS, AMC and MATHCOUNTS. As a person who solves a lot of these problems myself, I often find it difficult to organize problems for revision in an easy and comprehensive way due to the the lack of organization. 

The purpose of this terminal application is to simultaneously provide a place for users to solve math problems, find previously solved or unsolved problems (and be able to sort through them, whether that be in a datetime format or topic), and provide basic statistics about a user's particular weakness on a math subject. 

### Features

#### Feature 1: Problem-Solving Window - Solve problems

This feature is the main component that enables the user to read and receive problems. Problems sourced from math competitions are randomly selected depending on your initial skill level, and solving them through terminal input gives you EXP that go toward your skill exp bar. Upon a milestone in skill EXP, you level up and increase your chances of getting more difficult math problems.

#### Feature 2: Progress Window - Find previously solved problems

The progress window is a simple feature that tracks all of the problems that you have previously solved, or have failed to solve correctly. You can sort through these problems in the window by the problem's datetime (earliest solved/oldest solved), or by choosing the specific math topic of the problems.

#### Feature 3: User Stats Window - Find statistics about your math solving ability 

### Code Style
